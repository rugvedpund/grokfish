My attempt at understanding why the fish says what it does

Requirements can be installed with 
```python
pip install chess stockfish
```

Uses Stockfish's default piece square table to assign a score to the position. 
This should be helpful to people trying to understand how much of the fish's evaluation comes from its PST
